A person with a wound on his head keeps touching it
Lost is the person who forgets their past
The earings are given to those without ears
That who insulted you is that who told you about the insult
The camel went through labor only to give birth to a mouse
The mother of a monkey sees him as beautiful and graceful as a deer
If life gives you melons you might be dyslexic
It takes a lot of balls to golf the way I do
My father is schizophrenic but he is good people
I do not worry about terrorism I was married for two years
I like a woman with a head on her shoulders because I hate necks
My girlfriend has a body like a Greek statue completely pale and no arms
Trumps nothing like Hitler there is no way he could write a book
Most of my life is spent avoiding conflict I hardly ever visit Syria
Life is like a box of chocolates It does not last long if you are fat
Roses are red violets are blue I am a schizophrenic and so am I
Do Transformers get car or life insurance
I went to buy camouflage trousers but I could not find any
